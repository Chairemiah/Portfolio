## About me
Although new to the field, I am highly excited to enter Software QA. For a long time I always wanted to work in software but didn't think I would have the brain for it. After attempting different career paths I found myself still wanting something more for myself. I finally decided to take that leap and began my course at Mountainland Technical College (MTech). During my time there I found a strong passion for software development and testing.

My plan and current goal is to apply all that I've learned from my course to testing software products and gain hands-on experience. I still have much to learn, but I am truly excited to do so.
